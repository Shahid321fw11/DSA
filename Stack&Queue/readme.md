Stack Implementation
Stack is a data structure which follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) or First In Last Out (FIFO) principle.
We can think of a stack as, if we put plate on the plate and we want to remove the plate, we will have to wait for the plate to be removed.

Queue Implementation
Queue is a data structure which follows the First In First Out (FIFO) or Last In Last Out (LILO) principle.
We can think of a queue as a line of people waiting to be served. If new person come in the line, he/she will be added to the end of the line and if first person in the line is served, he/she will be removed from the line.
